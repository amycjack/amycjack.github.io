This week's TidyTuesday (10/10/2023) is representing the [USA haunting index](https://www.theshadowlands.net/places). The basemap of the USA was obtained from Nasa's [Blue Marble](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/collection/1484/blue-marble) collection which I overlap with USA and states lines obtains from the ggpackage ```maps```. I make use of the ```ggshadow``` package for glowing points, for a spooky effect.
