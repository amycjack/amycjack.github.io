I am an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in utilising genomics techniques for the protection and understanding of public health and environment.

I received by PhD in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Southampton in 2023 in partnership with the Natural History Museum (London), and I am currently working as a Research Associate at RBG Kew. My PhD research focused on using the island model system, the Canary Islands, to understand the diversification and adaptation of endemic plants using genomic techniques. My latest role at Kew Gardens is pivoted towards orphan crops - indigenous crops that are not typically internationally traded - with aims to accelerate their domesticated through genomics and gene-editing techniques.
