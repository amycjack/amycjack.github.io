I am an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in utilising genomics techniques for the protection and understanding of public health and environment. I received by PhD in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Southampton in 2023 in partnership with the Natural History Museum (London), and I am currently working as a Research Associate at RBG Kew.  

## Projects ##
### Canary Island plants ###

My PhD research focused on using the island model system, the Canary Islands, to understand the diversification and adaptation of endemic plants using genomic techniques.

### The domestication of orphan crops ###

My latest role at Kew Gardens is pivoted towards orphan crops - indigenous crops that are not typically internationally traded - with aims to accelerate their domesticated through genomics and gene-editing techniques.
