I am an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in utilising genomics techniques for the protection and understanding of public health and environment. I received by PhD in Evolutionary Biology from the University of Southampton in 2023 in partnership with the Natural History Museum (London), and I am currently working as a Research Associate at RBG Kew.

### The evolution of island plants ###

During my doctoral research, I focused on understanding the diversification and adaptation within endemic plant species, utilising the island model system exemplified by the Canary Islands. This archipelago comprises seven main islands located approximately 100 kilometres off the western coast of Africa. Originating from volcanic activity dating back as far as 20 million years, these islands boast a rich tapestry of distinctive habitats.

The geographical isolation, coupled with a spectrum of ecological niches, has fostered the numerous species exclusive to these unique islands. Among these is the Canary Island _Descurainia_ (Brassicaceae), encompassing seven species distributed across four of these islands. These species inhabit a diverse elevational range, thriving from sea level at 50 meters to as high as 2,200 meters in mountainous desert-like habitats.

My PhD thesis utilises genomic sequencing (14 genomes) of these seven species and bioinformatic analyses to understand the molecular underpinning of its adaptation to different ecological niches.

### The domestication of orphan crops ###

My latest role at Kew Gardens is pivoted towards orphan crops - indigenous crops that are not typically internationally traded - with aims to accelerate their domesticated through genomics and gene-editing techniques. White fonio is a small grain cereal crop native to West Africa. It is important due to its exceptional nutritional value, resilience to harsh growing conditions, and short maturation period. As a drought-resistant and nutrient-rich crop, white fonio plays a crucial role in providing food security, especially in regions with challenging agricultural environments. However, fonio displays a lack of domestication characteristics which hinders its potential as a global sustainable food item for a changing world. 

In collaboration with the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (Cambridge, UK), we aim to improve the domestication of white fonio through identifying and transforming candidate genes that could prove yield, such as reduction in seed shattering.
