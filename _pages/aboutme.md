I am an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in utilising genomics techniques for the protection and unserstanding of public health and environment.

My primiary research is focused on the diversification and adaptation of plants, with my study systems being island plants and crops. My PhD, which was carried out at the University of Southampton and the Natural History Museum, used genomics to understand a Canary Island _Descurainia_, a group of plants endemic to the Canary Islands.
